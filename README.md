# Descriptor for MapInfo
Descriptor program for MapInfo

This program works within MapInfo version 11.5 and higher.

The Descriptor extracts all points from a polygon and generates a textual description for use where a legal description of an area of land is required.

There are two files:

1. The MBX is the compiled MapBasic program which is ran through MapInfo

2. The MB file which is the MapBasic code and can be loaded into the MapBasic IDE

Please note that at the moment this program only works with polygons which have been created in a clockwise direction.
